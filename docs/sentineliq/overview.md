# SentinelIQ Overview

SentinelIQ is an enterprise-grade Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) platform designed to help security teams efficiently manage and respond to security incidents.

## Features

  Efficiently manage alerts with a dedicated and detailed Alert page. Make comments, identify similar alerts, define custom statuses and fields, and decide on escalation to investigations or incident response.

* **Case Management**  
  Streamline case creation with associated tasks and observables. Identify related cases and alerts, set PAP (Permissible Actions Protocol) levels on each Observable, and enhance Incident Response using a flexible template engine.

* **Multi-Tenant Environments**  
  Define organizations and teams for collaborative work. Customize permissions and roles to isolate or share cases between organizations.

* **Advanced User Management**  
  Customize user profiles and assignments within organizations. Synchronize users via LDAP or AD for streamlined management.

* **Notifications Framework**  
  Set up notification rules to trigger webhooks, emails, Slack/Mattermost messages, or custom HTTP requests based on specified events.

* **Metrics and Dashboards**  
  Utilize dynamic dashboarding to compile and correlate case statistics, tasks, observables, and metrics for generating KPIs and MBOs.

* **Comprehensive APIs**  
  Access fully documented APIs for implementing workflows and developing automated scripts using SentinelIQ data.

* **MISP Integration**  
  Seamlessly import and share Indicators of Compromise with MISP. Collaborate by connecting SentinelIQ with MISP to enhance threat intelligence sharing.

* **MITRE ATT&CK Integration**  
  Incorporate MITRE ATT&CK Framework TTPs into alert management. Import tactics and techniques into cases or alerts, or export to MISP events for broader threat analysis.

* **Case Reporting**  
  Generate detailed incident reports in markdown, DOCX or PDF format. Customize report templates based on content requirements and target audience.

* **Knowledge Base**  
  Centralize policies, procedures, best practices, and guidance within the in-app 'wiki' for quick access and support during incident response.
